# 👋 About Me — Black Falcon

My name is **Black Falcon**. I’m an early-stage learner in **ethical hacking** and I’m working to level up in penetration testing and systems analysis. I use this repository as my learning journal to document progress, hands-on labs, and technical notes.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Document learning step-by-step.
- Save lab reports and writeups.
- Collect small helper scripts and tools.
- Build a practical portfolio for job or freelance opportunities.
- Share reusable notes and checklists.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Skills I'm Learning
- Operating systems & testing: **Kali Linux**
- Web testing / proxy: **Burp Suite**, **OWASP ZAP**
- Network scanning: **Nmap**
- Exploitation frameworks: **Metasploit**
- Packet analysis: **Wireshark**
- Scripting / automation: **Python**, **Bash**
- Core concepts: **reconnaissance, vulnerability analysis, exploitation, reporting**

---

## 📂 Suggested Repository Structure
- `labs/` — practical labs (vulnerable VMs, CTF writeups)
- `writeups/` — step-by-step reports and solutions
- `tools/` — small scripts and utilities (with usage notes)
- `notes/` — theory notes, cheat-sheets
- `docs/` — reference resources, learning plans
- `README.md` — this main file

---

## ✍️ Simple Lab Report Template
1. **Overview** — lab name, objective, environment (e.g. local VM).
2. **Tools Used** — list tools and (if possible) versions.
3. **Execution Steps** — detailed commands and steps (include output or screenshots if available).
4. **Findings** — discovered issues, PoC, and impact.
5. **Remediation / Mitigation** — suggestions to fix or reduce risk.
6. **Attachments** — scripts, command outputs, notes.

## 🛡️ Ethical Rules (Important)
- I only test on authorized or owned environments and intentionally vulnerable labs.
- I do not use skills or tools to harm others.
- All content here is for learning, defense, and responsible disclosure only.

---

## 🗺️ Learning Roadmap (Brief)
- Fundamentals: Linux basics, networking, Python scripting.
- Discovery: scanning and fingerprinting with Nmap.
- Web testing: OWASP Top 10, Burp Suite workflows.
- Exploitation: Metasploit basics and simple PoCs.
- Documentation: writing clear, reproducible lab reports.

---

## 🚀 Optional Improvements (Later)
- Add `CONTRIBUTING.md` and a `LICENSE` if you want to accept contributions.
- Create a reusable `WRITEUP_TEMPLATE.md` to standardize reports.
- Keep a `weekly-log.md` to track progress over time.

---

If you want, I can also:
- Create a ready-to-use `WRITEUP_TEMPLATE.md` you can paste into `writeups/`.
- Make a darker “hacker-style” README variant (shorter or more stylized).
Tell me which one and I’ll generate it now.
